PDAP Blog
===

Our blog built off of the [Gatsby + Strapi Template](https://strapi.io/starters/strapi-starter-gatsby-blog)

Customizations:
* Removed UIKit and used TailwindCSS in its place
* Copied the header / nav from the main [PDAP.io](https://github.com/Police-Data-Accessibility-Project/PDAP.io) site
